## Notes on Views folder
This is where the areas and business rules of LifePIM are handled.

The subfolders are mini-applications, each of which look after the 
business rules, how to display and how to get the data.

Each view will "probably" have passed a 
- connection object = how to connect , logon and read / write info
- interface object = how to interact with data
