# LifePIM Desktop
https://www.lifepim.com lets you quickly manage and find everything - all lists, ideas, and notes, tasks, calendar events, logs, ETL jobs, images, music, videos, programs, etc.

This repository contains scripts and an upcoming Desktop version you can run
on your local PC (to keep sensitive data local).  You can still interface with
the live site but you get to choose which data gets uploaded to your lifepim
account.

## Status
Under development - nothing significant works yet!

2025 - restarting. Old code moved to N:\duncan\C\user\dev\src\python\z_bk_python\LifePIM_public_2024

## Quick Start
This github repository [https://github.com/acutesoftware/lifepim](https://github.com/acutesoftware/lifepim) contains the latest code, but the current public release is available via

`pip install lifepim`

This application is used to collect local metadata for indexing and allow for
automatic uploading to https://www.lifepim.com

To run the local web server, use
`python web_server.py`
