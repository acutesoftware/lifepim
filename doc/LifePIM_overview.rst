Setting up LifePIM for API access
------------------------------------------------
The first step is to make sure you have a valid LifePIM Pro account
- register a free account with https://www.lifepim.com/register
- go to the options screen and tick allow API access.
- download this library to connect to LifePIM (or write your own)
    - make sure you have your API key
    - keep your username / password in a separate file away from code
- run the test_api.py script to make sure everything works.

Import Transactions as Calendar Log events
------------------------------------------------

The steps for this are:
- export your transactions, and clean out the ones you want (ie ignore fees)
- modify the script bank_transactions.py to point to your LifePIM account
- run the script to load transactions
