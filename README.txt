LifePIM Desktop
https://www.lifepim.com is designed to be a Personal Information Manager for
Life, but not all personal data should be kept online.
Sure, it's fine to keep shopping lists, ideas, and notes and appointment reminders online  - but things like
passwords, some photos, that amazing idea for a perpetual motion machine should
be kept secure.

This repository contains scripts and an upcoming Desktop version you can run
on your local PC (to keep sensitive data local).  You can still interface with
the live site but you get to choose which data gets uploaded to your lifepim
account.

Planning stage - nothing significant works yet!
